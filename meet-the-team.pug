					h1 A Little About Myself
					p How I Became a Pet Minder
					p Dog walking and pet sitting has always been a passion of mine. Since I was young I’ve always loved animals — both learning about and taking care of them. I began Walk Fourward in 2017 when I moved to Perth, Australia from San Francisco, California. In California I raised rabbits, dairy goats, chickens, and bees on an urban farm. I now have the opportunity to share my love of animals with my clients and pet owners all around Perth. I hope I get the chance to meet your lovely pet soon.
